# 4V_Weather_Is_Sweet
The design is very basic. 
Also I've used my own SCSS before the JS, and then implementing bootstrap classes after. Rather to use bootstrap clases for ALL THE LAYOUT: Columns, Display-Flex and such.
To BE FAIR, you MUST test the project **on the commit 27**. 28 and 29 are way far of term.
